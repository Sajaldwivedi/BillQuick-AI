# Security Implementation - User Data Isolation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to ensure proper user data isolation in BillQuick AI.

## User Data Isolation

### 1. Database Level Security
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Implemented strict security rules that ensure users can only access their own data
- **User ID Filtering**: All database queries are filtered by the current user's ID
- **Authentication Required**: All data operations require valid user authentication

### 2. Application Level Security
- **User Authentication**: All pages and components check for user authentication
- **Data Filtering**: All data fetching functions include user ID parameters
- **Store Management**: Product store is cleared when users log out

### 3. Data Structure Changes
- **Product Model**: Added `userId` field to track ownership
- **Bill Model**: Added `userId` field to track ownership
- **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript interfaces to include user identification

## Security Rules

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read and write their own products
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users can only read and write their own bills
    match /bills/{billId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Context
- Extended auth context to include logout functionality
- Added user state management across the application
- Implemented proper session handling

### 2. Data Access Functions
- Updated all Firestore functions to require user ID
- Implemented proper error handling for unauthorized access
- Added user validation before data operations

### 3. UI Components
- Added authentication checks in all data-dependent components
- Implemented loading states for authenticated users
- Added proper error messages for unauthorized access

## Security Benefits

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: Users can only see and modify their own data
2. **Database Level Protection**: Security rules prevent unauthorized access even if client-side code is bypassed
3. **Session Management**: Proper logout functionality clears all user data
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures user ID is always included in data operations

## Deployment Notes

1. **Firestore Rules**: Deploy the `firestore.rules` file to your Firebase project
2. **Existing Data**: Existing data without user IDs will need to be migrated or recreated
3. **Testing**: Test with multiple user accounts to ensure proper isolation

## Migration Guide

For existing data, you'll need to:
1. Add `userId` field to existing products and bills
2. Update any existing queries to include user filtering
3. Test the application with multiple user accounts

## Best Practices

1. Always check for user authentication before data operations
2. Use the `useAuth` hook to access current user information
3. Clear stores when users log out
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
5. Test with multiple user accounts regularly
